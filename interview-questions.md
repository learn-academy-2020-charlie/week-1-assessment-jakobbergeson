# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a block of reusable code that takes in an argument or arguments and outputs a result.

  Researched answer: "A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value."

2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: The difference between map and filter is that map loops through an array and unselectively creates an additional array while filter loops through an array with an if conditional creating a selective "filter".

  Researched answer: "They both return a new array. map returns a new array of elements where you have applied some function on the element so that it changes the original element (typically). filter returns a new array of the elements of the original array (with no change to the original values). filter will only return elements where the function you specify returns a value of true for each element passed to the function."

3. What is the difference between map/filter and a for loop?

  Your answer: Map/filter are higher order functions that create a new array from the original. For loop only runs through the original array without creating another array.

  Researched answer: "Loops are generally used, in any programming language, to perform operations on arrays: given an array you can iterate over its elements and perform a calculation."
  "map returns an array with the same length,"
  "filter as the name implies, it returns an array with less"

4. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: The difference is that return is used as a mechanism in a function to output a value and console.log places a value into a function which is used for development testing purposes.

  Researched answer: "console.log will display the parameter passed to the log method in the console window. Use this method to display a string or variable in the console window."
  "When using the return statement, the function will stop executing, and return the specified value."

5. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is a value or a set of values that are accepted by a function in order to return a new value.

  Researched answer: "In computer programming, a parameter or a formal argument, is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine."

6. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: In pair programming two devs tackle a single programming challenge together. One physically types in the code making sure to watch out for typing errors to the best of their ability. This position is called the "driver". The other coder is formulating the solution for programming challenge and communicating that to the driver while also double checking the code for any errors. This position is called the "navigator".

  Researched answer: "Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the “driver”, the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the “navigator”; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so."

7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Hard to come up with a single answer because the whole week was packed with useful information! However, I would say that the two things that were specifically helpful to me were the paired programming challenges that we did everyday and the end of week assessment. Really awesome to have someone else help you with new topics and then be able to try out those topics by yourself.
